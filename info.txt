🏗️ Technologies Used in Your System
🔹 1️⃣ Backend Framework

Flask

Python web framework

Handles API requests

Receives image from Android / Postman

Returns JSON response

Example endpoint:

POST /recognize

🔹 2️⃣ Face Detection Model

RetinaFace

Purpose:

Detect face in image

Give bounding box

Give facial landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth)

Align face properly

Why RetinaFace?

Very accurate

Works well with ArcFace

Production-level detector

🔹 3️⃣ Face Embedding Model

ArcFace (via InsightFace – buffalo_l model)

This is the MOST IMPORTANT part.

ArcFace:

Deep CNN model

Generates 512-dimensional embedding

Trained on millions of faces

State-of-the-art accuracy

Embedding Example:

[0.0234, -0.1456, 0.8876, .... 512 values]

🔹 4️⃣ Embedding Comparison Technique

Cosine Similarity

Formula used:

𝑐
𝑜
𝑠
(
𝜃
)
=
𝐴
⋅
𝐵
∣
∣
𝐴
∣
∣
∣
∣
𝐵
∣
∣
cos(θ)=
∣∣A∣∣∣∣B∣∣
A⋅B
	​


In Python:

np.dot(a, b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))


Why cosine?

Best for face embeddings

Works well with ArcFace

Industry standard

📦 Exact Model Used

When we wrote:

FaceAnalysis(name="buffalo_l")


It loads:

Component	Model
Detector	RetinaFace
Recognition	ArcFace
Embedding Size	512
Framework	ONNX / InsightFace
🎯 If Interviewer Asks You

You can say confidently:

"I built a face recognition attendance system using RetinaFace for face detection and ArcFace deep learning model for 512-dimensional embedding extraction. I used cosine similarity for identity matching and deployed it using Flask REST API."

🔥 That sounds professional.

⚡ Alternative Option (Not Used)

We DID NOT use:

Haar Cascade ❌

LBPH ❌

dlib face_recognition ❌

MTCNN ❌

SVM ❌

We used modern deep learning approach.
